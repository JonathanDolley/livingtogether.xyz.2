I want to offer a glimpse into my intellectual journey over the past few years of my research about Hansalim.
So in this post I will describe the various authors I have been getting to know, what questions led me to read their works and why I think they are relevant to understanding the significance of Hansalim's journey.

In a way, this will also illustrate my research method which I am calling "plural critical narrative".

# Narrative

Narrative, because my starting conviction is that our view of the world and our place in it is a central factor in our capacity for collective action to transform food systems away from unjust and destructive patterns towards fairer and more sustainable alternatives.
And the way in which we move from worldview to action is through narrative:

> "[a] narrative understanding of our place in the world integrates our phenomenological experiences with our moral aspirations, ... Whilst we are examining our phenomenological experiences, the transition from experience itself to reflection and to interpretation permits us to illuminate our scope of action. This then extends out fruitfully into our capacity for both social critique and social transformation." [^1]

Consequently, my main materials are:

1. the life stories of people involved with Hansalim;
2. the stories that Hansalim as an organisation tells about itself through its own publications;
3. the historical narratives that form the context of Hansalim's own story;
4. the stories we tell each other about the future either in fear or in hope;
5. the mythic narratives that often implicitly lie behind our various worldviews and attitudes towards science, technology and community.

# Critical

Critical, because by retelling and reflecting on our stories 

which I think of as consisting of one part curiosity, one part serendipity and one part 

With a lack of academic material or english language history about Hansalim, my starting point was of course Hansalim's own published documents. 

including the Hansalim Manifest,
