So I thought I would try to use ChatGPT to help me plan my itinerary for visiting Europe to meet co-operative practitioners and academics.

## Months to avoid

First I asked it:

> I want to have meetings with people in business and academia in various cities. I want to make sure people are likely to be available when I visit each city. Can you tell me which months I should avoid? Give me your reasons. Format answers in a table with columns ‘city’, ‘months to avoid’, ‘reasons’. Here are the cities: Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, Berlin, Paris, Ghent, Vienna, Barcelona, Florence. And the capital cities of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Czechia.

This was its answer:

{{< table >}}
|City |	Months to Avoid |	Reasons |
|---|---|---|
| Copenhagen |	November - February |	Cold, dark and rainy, fewer events and travel |
| Stockholm	| December - February |	Extremely cold, snowy, and fewer events |
|Helsinki|	December - February|	Dark, cold, and snowy with fewer events|
|Berlin|	December - February|	Cold, dark, and rainy with fewer events|
|Paris|	July - August|	Many people go on vacation, fewer events|
|Ghent|	July - August|	Many people go on vacation, fewer events|
|Vienna|	July - August|	Many people go on vacation, fewer events|
|Barcelona|	August|	Crowded with tourists and high temperatures|
|Florence|	July - August|	Crowded with tourists and high temperatures|
|Warsaw|	December - February|	Cold, dark, and snowy with fewer events|
|Riga|	December - February|	Cold, dark, and snowy with fewer events|
|Vilnius|	December - February|	Cold, dark, and snowy with fewer events|
|Bratislava|	December - February|	Cold, dark, and snowy with fewer events|
|Prague|	December - February|	Cold, dark, and snowy with fewer events|

## Best months to visit

Next I asked it:

> Now give me a list of the best months to visit each city for the same purpose.

And this is what I got back:

{{< table >}}
|City|	Best Months to Visit|	Reasons|
|---|---|---|
|Copenhagen|	May - September|	Pleasant weather with longer days, many cultural and business events, and academic activities.|
|Stockholm|	May - September	|Mild weather with longer days, many cultural and business events, and academic activities.|
