Having done several interviews with Hansalim directors, activists and producers in and around Seoul, Gyeongi (greater Seoul) and Paju I am starting on some regional case studies in Busan and Jeju.

## Busan

I will travel to Busan this week to interview three groups: consumer co-op directors, employees and producers.
I am told that Busan Hansalim works a little differently from the capital region co-operatives so it will be interesting to compare their experience and perspectives with those of my previous interviewees.
They apparently have a stronger emphasis on relationships with local farmers while many other parts of Hansalim are more closely integrated with the central distribution hub.

I will share some photos and reflections from the trip on this blog in the weeks following.

## Juju

Jeju is an interesting example of a localized multi-stakeholder structure which I expect to have closer interaction between consumers and producers because it is a sub-tropical island which is more difficult to integrate with the central distribution system.
Jeju is also known for their emphasis on natural farming techniques and multi-farm circulating farming systems.
In addition, Jeju Hansalim has been carrying out a formal social accounting process to monitor the outcomes of their activities not just in economic terms but also social and environmental.
So I anticipate a very interesting visit to Jeju this summer.
