# a summary about you
summary: 'This 3 year research project is a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) - Global Fellowship led by [Dr Jonathan Dolley](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p133363-jonathan-dolley) and supervised by the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/business-school/people-and-departments/spru) and the [Mosim and Salim Research Institute](http://mosim.or.kr/), Hansalim (South Korea). Through this project I am investigating the story of the Korean cooperative, [Hansalim](http://eng.hansalim.or.kr/), which grew from a small rice market on the outskirts of Seoul in 1986 to become one of the worlds largest organic food cooperatives with 750,000 members and producers. I want to find out what lessons their experience holds for other cooperative groups and movements in the UK and EU as we strive to transform our food systems away from industrialized models towards a fairer and more sustainable future.'
