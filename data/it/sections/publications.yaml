  paper:
    summary: In this paper, we draw on a reinterpretation of empirical data concerned with land-use change and multiple dimensions of food security from the city of Wuhan in China to illustrate some of the complex trade-offs between SDG goals that tend to be overlooked with current planning approaches. We then describe the development of an interactive web-based tool that implements deep learning methods for fine-grained land-use classification of high-resolution remote sensing imagery and integrates this with a flexible method for rapid trade-off analysis of land-use change scenarios. The development and potential use of the tool are illustrated using data from the Wuhan case study example. This tool has the potential to support participatory planning processes by providing a platform for multiple stakeholders to explore the implications of planning decisions and land-use policies.

  paper:
    summary: "Enhancing propoor transformative agency in Periurban contexts. In this paper we discuss how transdisciplinary development research (TDR), if approached in particular ways, can not only produce new knowledge, but also foster deeper systemic changes in the knowledge system itself. We are concerned with systemic change that supports pro-poor sustainability transformations, and conceptualise the processes that contribute to this type of systemic change as 'transformative space making' (TSM)."

  paper:
    summary: "Processes of urbanisation are implicated in worsening environmental degradationand  poverty,  while  at  the  same  time  cities  often  drive  growth  and  innovation. Essential connections between people and the environment are often obscured inthe  drive  for  economic  growth,  infrastructural  development  and  mainstreaminitiatives for clean and green urban centres. As in rural contexts, urban and peri-urban  ecosystem  services  have  critical  roles  to  play  in  underpinning  sustainable development,  and  will  be  key  to  building  ‘resilient’  towns  and  cities."

  paper:
    summary: "The Energy Self-Sufficient Village (ESSV) movement, which relies heavily on voluntary resident participation, is a local response to climate change and the energy crisis in South Korea. This study aims to explore why participants get involved in the ESSV movement and how they have changed and grown through their ESSV experience, and to understand these findings from an 'ecological citizenship' perspective. The findings of this study ― which reveal behavioral and attitudinal changes experienced by adult participants with average levels of education and environmental awareness ― can inform strategies for expanding energy transition movements to reach the greater public."

  paper:
    summary: "'Energy education as a new way of life' is likely to be realized in local communities. If we provide energy education in consideration of the unique context of the local community, we can form learner's sense of place and deal with real-life problems. However, the contents of energy education, which are implemented in some villages, do not tend to reflect local contexts or learners' everyday lives. The purpose of this study is to explore how locality can be achieved in environmental education programs."

  paper:
    summary: "Social interest in Zero Energy Buildings(ZEBs) is increasing for energy saving through building energy efficiency improvement. Accordingly, zero-energy housing complexes were built with policy support, in which residents live, and whose performance are being monitored. However, researches on ZEBs have been conducted only focusing on their technical aspect, but there has been few researches integrating social aspects with residents' responses and interactions. The purpose of this paper is to explore how zero energy housing works in reality and how citizens interact with the technology, through a qualitative case study on A housing complex. As a result, problems such as defects and unexpected energy use have been revealed, contrary to public expectations and publicity. In particular, management and operation based on expertism and bureaucracy caused conflict with residents' desire for democratic decision-making and participation. This study suggests the need for citizens as technology users to actively participate in technological innovation, in the journey of energy transition toward a sustainable society and system."

  paper:
    summary: "Zero-energy building technology is considered as a sustainable housing technology responding to the climate crisis. However, discussion and researches have been rarely conducted on the role of citizens and learning in the discourse of technology determinism and expertism. This study explored how citizens learn and produce their lay knowledge through a qualitative case study on residents of a zero energy housing complex, called A-house. Findings revealed that residents were opposed to one-sided transmissive education. Expansive learning emerged as residents tried to reveal and solve the 'problems' they had faced. They had different perspectives and interests from experts about technology, and produced unique lay knowledge. However, their efforts were limited in that they had difficulty achieving changes and forming a greater vision. This study suggests that transition to a sustainable social system requires transformative learning approach in which diverse perspectives on knowledge and citizens' active participation are premised."
